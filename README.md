![Screenshot of the performance](useofpc2017pt2-thumb.jpg?raw=true "The Use of a Personal Computer 2017, pt.2")

Using openFrameworks 0.9.8, Visual Studio 2015 and the following plugins:

- ofxBeat.h
- ofxGui.h
- ofxAssimpModelLoader.h
- ofxPostProcessing.h
- ofxGLFWJoystick.h

Completely an approach of scraping something together and making it work for one-off occasion, but sharing such code is more helpful than not sharing anything. â˜º
